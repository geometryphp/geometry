# Errors

## What is an error?

An error is anything that prevents a function from completing its goal.

## Types of errors

* Precondition: Anything that prevents the function from starting because it requires certain values to be established to begin for example.
* Postcondition: Anything that prevents the function from completing its goal. For example if the function needs to produce a certain value and there's something that prevents it from procuding that value; that will cause an error.
