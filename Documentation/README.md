# Geometry

Status: Not for production use. Geometry is currently under development. I'm currently developing the framework under a real-world project. Once the project is completed, the framework should be available.

## Introduction

Geometry is a PHP framework for web applications built on php/mysql/apache stacks. Inspired by Symfony and Laravel, Geometry provides the bare minimal setup for getting your web application on its legs and running.

The framework will be separated into two packages: *Geometry*, the framework's skeleton or directory layout; and *Octagon*, the framework's muscle or core or the components that help alleviate the overhead existent in the early development of a web application.

## Goals

- Provide only the bare minimal services for a web application.
- Be elegant in architecture and user experience.
- Stand in the likes of the big boys (Symfony, Laravel, etc.)

## Documentation

*Documentation will be written soon.*

## The Why

**Background.** *Draft.* I created Geometry because I needed a framework that I understood. Plus I needed a project to work on. I bought *PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practices* and figured that this would help me learn PHP more. And I read that you can make a your own framework that fits your needs.

**Ambition.** *Draft.* Geometry aims to become a stable and well-designed production framework. Currently, Geometry is at a stage of infancy. I'm currently learning about the workings of web application framework. I will improve the framework over several iterations. Geometry will remain simple in its goals. However, the framework will be built to be architecturally sound.
