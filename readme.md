# Geometry

This framework is intended for internal use. The framework is currently under development.

# Introduction

Geometry is a PHP framework for web applications built on php/mysql/apache stacks. Geometry provides a bare minimal setup for getting your web application on its legs and running.

The framework is divided into two packages: *Geometry* the skeleton (or directory layout) of the framework, and *Octagon* the framework's muscle or the components that help alleviate the overhead existent in the early development of a web application.

## Goals

* Provide only the bare minimal services for a web application.
* Be elegant in architecture and user experience.
* Stand in the likes of the big boys (Symfony, Laravel, etc.)

## Why

We created Geometry because we needed a framework that we understood. We needed to make a framework that fitted our needs.

Geometry aims to become a stable and well-designed production framework. Currently, Geometry is at a stage of infancy. We're learning about the workings of web application frameworks. We will improve the framework over several iterations. Geometry will remain simple in its goals; at the same time it shall be built architecturally sound.
